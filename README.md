# Pyautomaton

Python utility to automate various repetitive web-based tasks with Selenium.

## Project Context:

Our modern lives are filled with routine computing tasks, especially for those in the IT field. In this project, I aim to learn about Selenium, further grow my understanding of Python, and increase the efficiency of my BPA development work. To give my efforts direction, I aim to automate away some 'low-hanging fruit' web tasks that are in my life. The intended result is to free up the user for more human-based tasks. Let bots do bot things, let humans do human things.
